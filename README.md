## Project Abstract
Augur is fully functional prototyping web stack for CHAOSS metrics. It provides structured data mined from git repositories using a plugin architecture that incorporates other open source metrics projects like Facade and FOSSology. The main aim of this project is to extend Augurâ€™s functionality by implementing Risk and Growth-Maturity-Decline CHAOSS metrics and use cases with a focus on the open source community manager use case. This project, with a focus on the community manager use case, will allow open source community managers to leverage Risk and Growth-Maturity-Decline metrics to better manage their communities and projects.
